# hm_hauptseminar_vcml
This repository contains the experiments performed as part of the advanced seminar in the summer semester 2025 of the Computer Science master's program with a focus on VCML at HM Hochschule MÃ¼nchen University of Applied Sciences.

The repository is divided into subprojects for both RGB-based SLAM methods, GlORIE-SLAM and HI-SLAM2.

The Deliverables directory contains the seminar paper, all the slides, and the videos presented during the seminar.

It is recommended to use a native Linux machine for working with this repository (especially with Ubuntu 22.04).
To set up the required Python environments, the Conda package management and environment management system is needed.
